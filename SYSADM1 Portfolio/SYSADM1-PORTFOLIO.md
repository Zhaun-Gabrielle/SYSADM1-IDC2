**First Grading**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27154371-8888-4559-90e3-6de19e542a6f)
                                                                                       

The first quiz we had back in the first grading. If I remembered correctly, the 
topic was all about incase of service disruptions, how do you ensure the availability 
of critical data. At the time, my mind was full of answers and at the end, I ended up 
filling my ¼ paper with answers. I remembered that there are still some that I wanted 
to write in my paper but I don't have enough space to write anymore so I just submitted 
my paper. Little did I know this was just the start of our jurney in SYSADM1, as we go 
further, topics go deep and deeper

Our first Case Study Activity during the prelims was about the roles of a system 
administrator and the pros and cons of manual system management and using automated 
tools. It was a fun activity that made us think about what the best answer is for a 
given situation. We learned that system administrators are important for keeping systems 
running smoothly, but deciding whether to manage systems manually or with automated 
tools depends on the task. Manual management can take a lot of time and cause mistakes,
but it’s flexible. On the other hand, automated tools help reduce errors and are faster,
but they need to be set up right and might not handle everything. This case study showed
us the need to know when to use each method to keep systems safe and working well.

  One of my favorite lab activities during the prelims was managing services in   
  Windows. In this activity, we learned how to stop, restart, pause, and start    
  different services, among other options. This helped me realize that opening    
  and closing programs isn\'t just about clicking on them; we can also manage     
  them through the services menu. This is especially useful when a program        
  refuses to start, even after trying to open it multiple times. Overall, the     
  activity taught me a new way to control and troubleshoot programs, making it    
  easier to fix problems that might come up.                                      

**Midterms**

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03061d78-8ce9-4f79-8fee-7cf2872ce317)
                                                                                 

  For our midterm, one of the activities we did was monitoring a server. We 
  were given an image showing server statistics, and our task was to identify 
  key metrics used to monitor the server. We also had to describe what we saw 
  in the image, including details like requests per second, error rate, and 
  common error types. I scored 38/40 because I got the requests per                             
  second wrong. This activity made me realize that it's similar to what we 
  learned in our Operating Systems (OPSYS) class during our first year, where 
  we discussed how logs may appear in different seconds but actually happen 
  at the same time. This happens because of the \"first come, first served\" 
  rule or other configurations set by the system. I also learned how important 
  it is to accurately interpret server data since it helps identify 
  performance issues or potential errors that could affect the server's operation. 
  Monitoring a server requires attention to detail and a good understanding of 
  how different metrics impact the system as a whole. This activity gave me 
  hands-on experience with server monitoring and reinforced the importance 
  of tracking key metrics to ensure smooth system performance. It was                         
  a great opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, 
  and I look forward to learning more about server management in the future.

  Another fun activity we did in our SYSADM1 subject was setting up a web server. This activity                         
  was both fun and informative because it guided us through the steps of implementing a web                             
  server. At first, we encountered some errors, like not being able to use the link we created                          
  to access the server. When we typed the URL, it didn't direct us to the main page. After some                         
  debugging, I realized that the problem was that we weren't supposed to create a new link.                             
  Instead, we needed to direct the page to the DNS of the server we created. This was the                               
  reason the wrong page kept showing up whenever we entered the link we had made. This activity                         
  taught me the importance of correctly configuring DNS settings and how small mistakes can                             
  lead to big issues in server setup. It was a great hands-on learning experience, and it gave                          
  me a better understanding of how web servers work and how to troubleshoot common problems                             
  that can arise when setting one up.                                                                                   


 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9623bc4e-5b9b-4db2-9391-ff5a7daf392d)
                                                                                   

  Another one of my favorite activities we did was about File Servers, Network File Storage,                            
  Mobile Synchronization, Web Servers, Load Balancers, and more. It was one of my favorites                             
  because it was a group activity, and Ma'am Kath made it really fun by turning it into a game.                         
  Each of us had to find our own group based on a clue she gave us. My clue was easy, so I                              
  quickly figured out which group I belonged to. However, some of my classmates had a harder                            
  time because their clues were more confusing. Once we identified our groups, the task was to                          
  create a sentence that would describe our group based on the clues each member had. Our                               
  group's focus was on File Servers and Mobile Synchronization. This activity was enjoyable                             
  because it allowed us to work together, think critically, and learn about the different                               
  topics in a fun and interactive way. It was a great way to dive deeper into the subject while                         
  strengthening teamwork and problem-solving skills.                                                                    


**Finals**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a75c9df-d5b6-4d11-8d24-7319ba1c2c26)
                                                              

  For our finals, we had another case study, and this time it was about TechGuard Solutions and 
  how they handled a cybersecurity crisis. The case study focused on a malware attack they      
  faced and the strategies they used to recover. It was fascinating to see how their            
  preparation, especially their recovery disk strategy, played a big role in solving the        
  problem. We learned how the company used offline backups and decryption tools to restore      
  their data without giving in to the attackers, which showed the importance of being proactive 
  in cybersecurity. The case also highlighted the need for regular employee training and        
  continuous updates to security protocols to prevent future incidents. Reflecting on this, it  
  became clear to me how critical it is for companies to have strong recovery and prevention    
  plans in place. It was a great learning experience that emphasized not just solving issues    
  when they arise but also being prepared for anything that might happen.

  This task was one of the final activities we completed in SYSADM1, and it was a paired 
  activity that really challenged us to think critically. The task required us to understand, 
  evaluate, and create a solution for an e-commerce network topology. The given topology had 
  several major issues, such as scalability problems, security risks, and bottlenecks, 
  which made us think deeply about how to address these challenges. We proposed solutions 
  like implementing firewalls for added security, introducing redundant network devices 
  for load balancing, and ensuring redundancy to prevent downtime. This activity not 
  only tested our technical knowledge but also pushed us to think like network engineers. 
  We had to put ourselves in the shoes of professionals who face these real-world 
  challenges every day. It helped us realize that network engineers must constantly 
  adapt to solve issues related to network growth and efficiency, and this experience 
  opened our eyes to the complexities of designing scalable and secure networks. 
  Overall, the activity was an invaluable learning experience that taught us how to
  approach and solve problems that companies face in their day-to-day operations, and 
  it reinforced the importance of planning for future network needs.

  Continuing from the previous reflection, we created a topology to help the company solve its   
  current problems while also preparing for future challenges. It felt like a big responsibility 
  because we had to design a network that would improve performance, reliability, and security.  
  We focused on scalability to handle future growth, redundancy to avoid single points of        
  failure, and traffic distribution to prevent bottlenecks. We also made sure the design         
  protected their data with strong security measures. This experience taught me the importance   
  of teamwork and careful planning because every decision had to be well thought out. It was     
  challenging, but it felt rewarding to create a solution that not only fixes current issues but 
  also supports the company's success in the long run.
