# SYSADM1-IDC2

## SYSADM1 Portfolio 

This repository contains my work and projects for the System Administration 1 (SYSADM1) course. It showcases my progress and learning throughout the subject, covering various activities, case studies, and quizzes.

### Project Description 

The SYSADM1 Portfolio is a compilation of:

- **Quizzes:** Demonstrating my understanding of concepts like ensuring the availability of critical data during service disruptions.
- **Case Studies:** Analyzing scenarios such as manual vs. automated system management and the roles of system administrators.
- **Lab and Lecture Activities:** Practical exercises and discussions that build skills in managing file systems, configuring services, and applying system administration best practices.

This repository highlights my journey in mastering system administration concepts and applying them to real-world scenarios.

## Organization of Activities

The repository is structured into three main folders:

1. First Grading Activities
2. Midterm Activities
3. Finals Activities

Each folder contains two subfolders:

### Lab Activity:

- Includes a Download Files folder where all downloadable files used in the activities are stored.
  
### Lecture Activity:

- Contains images of the activities we completed during the lecture portion.
  
This structure ensures easy navigation and access to specific materials.
