    users, while Print Inspector\'s capacity is not specified but likely
    focuses on remote user monitoring.

-   **Environment**: PaperCut is suitable for single to multi-server,
    multi-site, and clustered environments, whereas Print Inspector
    primarily manages printer queue and auditing.

-   **Printer Monitoring:** PaperCut monitors locally attached or
    workgroup printers, while Print Inspector records detailed
    information about all printed documents, including user and computer
    details.

-   **Language Support:** PaperCut is available in 20+ languages and
    currency formats, while Print Inspector does not specify language
    support.

    languages (PCL, PCL6, HPGL, PostScript, PCL-GUI), while Print
    Inspector does not specify supported print languages.

-   **Export Data:** PaperCut does not mention export capabilities,
    while Print Inspector allows data export for further processing.

-   **Queue Management:** Queue management is implied for PaperCut,
    while Print Inspector offers dedicated management features for print
    jobs in the queue.

-   **System Impact**: PaperCut may change system files, whereas Print
    Inspector makes no changes to system files and can load on Windows
    start-up.

> Report:
>
> System uptime: 10m and 59s (Started after installation)
>
> Data: No data acquired, need to wait 2 days to gather and compute data
>
> Printer: EPSON printer installed as default in the third party app
>
> Pricing: The app features a pricing system for printing
>
> The app has an environmental feature

-   Analyze the collected data (e.g., print volume, errors, user
    activity).
