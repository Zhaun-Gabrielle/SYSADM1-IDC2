# SYSADM1 -- Data Loss

Instruction/s:

Read and analyze the data loss scenarios provided. Create a data
recovery plan by providing impact assessment, recovery plan and
preventive measures for each scenario. Lastly, answer the reflection
question.

**Evaluation Criteria Guide:**

1.  Impact Assessment:

-   Accurately identifies the potential consequences of the data loss.

-   Quantifies the potential financial, operational, and reputational
    impact.

    1.  Recovery Plan:

-   Proposes a detailed, feasible, and timely recovery plan.

-   Includes steps for data restoration, system recovery, and business
    continuity.

-   Identifies the necessary resources and personnel.

    1.  Preventive Measures:


-   Recommends specific measures to prevent similar incidents in the
    future.

-   Addresses potential vulnerabilities in security, hardware, and
    software.

-   Proposes regular backups, security audits, and employee training.

-   Recommends appropriate RAID levels for data redundancy and
    performance.

Reflection Question

How would you explain to your company's stakeholders if, despite your best efforts, some data was still unrecoverable after implementing data recovery measures? What steps would you take to mitigate the impact of this data loss and prevent future occurrences?

I can explain the situation to our company’s stakeholders by saying that, despite our best efforts and the implementation of data recovery measures, some data remains unrecoverable due to the extent of the issue. I understand how this affects our operations, and we are actively working to minimize further disruptions by prioritizing restoring critical systems and keeping all affected parties updated. To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will enhance our backup strategies by conducting regular tests, ensuring backups are stored in multiple locations, and providing additional training for our team on proper data management and recovery procedures. Additionally, I can use the “Virus” scenario, as mentioned by Ma’am Kath in our previous lecture-discussion, in case things get out of hand, but only if necessary.
